This program reads information from an input file and places the information into a linked list. The linked list is displayed in its normal form, along with its reversed form. The user is prompted to remove items from the list if they choose to do so. The list is then printed again after items have been removed. The user is notified if they tried to remove an item not present in the list. A sample input and output file have been provided.

This program was written for the Advanced C Programming course with UCSC Extension.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.
